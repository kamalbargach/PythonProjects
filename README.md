# PythonProjects
Here is the repository grouping some of the projects I have worked on during my education.
You will be able to find the two projects I have talked about during the interview: 
- The predictions of the wind speed based on climat data and the implementation of the mathematical optimization models for the DA price
- The biomarkers and emotions projects including supervised and non-supervised learning methods
